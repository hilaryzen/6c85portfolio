				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The jump in new Covid cases from late December 2021 to early January 2022 (the end of the current data in the visualization) is much steeper than any previous increase or peak.</li>
				<li>In 2021, the number of new cases was at its lowest in the summer months (May - early July), but began increasing throughout August and peaked in September, perhaps due to schools and college reopening for everyone. Although I believe the lockdown was not as strict in summer 2021, people were still not traveling as they normally would during summer.</li>
				<li>Although the number of cases in December 2021 appears to be lower than in December 2020, new cases only slightly increased in January 2021. Meanwhile, cases in January 2022 are already about double the number in mid-December 2021, showing the much more contagious nature of Omnicron and how recent this spike in cases is.</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I really liked how they placed Jan 2022 at the top of the visualization, where readers look first. As their attention moves downward, the year labels (2021 and 2020) tell the reader that this visualization uses data throughout the entire pandemic to tell its story. 
					The spiral timeline was an unfamiliar visualization format for me and likely most other readers, but labels were very well-positioned in the places where I first looked. They helped me understand immediately the purpose of this visualization, and I was able to interpret the rest of the data and look for insights without first having to put the data together to understand the visualization.
				</li>
				<li>Presenting the line graph as a spiral so that the months of each year line up is a very effective format for allowing comparisons between the same month of different years. This is uniquely important for Covid and public health in general, since people's behavior varies wildly between seasons and provides context for reported Covid case numbers.</li>
				<li>
					Duplicating the line graph on both sides of the black spiral helped with comparing magnitudes between months, but I found it difficult to figure out which month had more new cases and by how much. 
					Even when the months were aligned like January 2021 and January 2022, I couldn't tell if their peaks were about even or had a significant difference. I found it even more difficult for different months, like January 2022 and September 2021. These two are far apart and angled differently in the visualization, which could be a deliberate design choice if the authors wanted to discourage comparisons between different months.
					Having some axis labels or numeric labels over the peaks would have helped answer the questions I had. </li>
